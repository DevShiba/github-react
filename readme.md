# GitHub User Search

This project is a web application designed to search for GitHub users and display their profile information. It allows users to search for any GitHub user and gain insights into their public repositories, followers, following, and public gists. The application is crafted using React and leverages the GitHub API to retrieve user data. Styled Components are used for CSS, enhancing the visual aesthetics of the application. React Router Dom is incorporated to provide a superior navigation experience. Fusion Charts are utilized for a more intuitive and interactive data visualization. Axios is employed to fetch data from the GitHub API.
